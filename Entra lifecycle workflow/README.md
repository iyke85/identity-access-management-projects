# Introduction

This project demonstrates end-to-end identity lifecycle automation across both Okta and Microsoft Entra environments. By configuring Joiner, Mover, and Leaver workflows in Entra and setting up attribute-based access controls and policy enforcement in Okta, the solution provides a coordinated, secure, and automated way to handle user provisioning, access transitions, and offboarding.
# Project Title
Automated Office 365 User Onboarding with Okta Workflows
# Project Overview
Built an automated identity onboarding solution using Okta Workflows to provision Office 365 access for newly created users. The workflow assigns users to the appropriate Office 365 access group and sends real-time email notifications to IT for visibility and audit tracking.
# Tools & Technologies

# Project Title
# Automated User Suspension Handling and Notification with Okta Workflows
![Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/VUiyeiv.png)
# Project Overview
Designed and implemented an automated identity governance workflow using Okta Workflows to handle user suspension events. The workflow adds suspended users to a dedicated security group right away and sends an automated email notification, improving visibility, audit readiness, and response time during account lifecycle events.
 # Workflow Logic
- Triggered automatically when a user account is suspended in Okta
- Retrieves the suspended user’s profile details for context and logging
- Adds the user to a predefined Suspended Users group for centralized tracking
- Sends an automated email notification to IT/Security via Office 365
- Logs the workflow execution for audit and troubleshooting purposes

- Ensured immediate and consistent handling of suspended accounts
- Eliminated manual tracking of suspended users
- Improved security visibility through real-time notifications
- Supported audit and compliance requirements by maintaining group-based records
- Reduced risk of delayed response during security or HR-driven suspensions
# Key Skills Demonstrated
- Identity lifecycle automation
- Security-focused workflow design
- Okta event-based triggers
- Group-based access control
- Automated notification and audit workflows
# Project Title
Contractor Access Control Using Attribute-Based Grouping and Adaptive Policies in Okta
# Project Overview
Designed and implemented a secure contractor access model in Okta using attribute-based group rules and targeted authentication policies. The solution automatically classifies contractor accounts, enforces stronger password requirements, and applies multi-factor authentication to reduce risk associated with non-employee access.
# Tools & Technologies
- Okta Identity Cloud
- Okta Universal Directory
- Okta Group Rules
- Okta Password Policies
- Okta Enrollment and Authentication Policies

# Implementation Details
- Attribute-Based Group Assignment
- Created a Contractor group in Okta
- Implemented a group rule that automatically adds users to the Contractor group when the department attribute equals contractor
- Ensured dynamic, scalable group membership without manual intervention
# Contractor Password Policy
- Created a dedicated password policy for contractors
- Enforced a minimum 12-character password length
- Applied stricter password standards to contractor accounts to reduce credential-based risk
# Authentication and Enrollment Policy
- Configured a contractor-specific enrollment and authentication policy
- Required authentication using:
- Password
- Okta Verify as an additional factor
- Restricted authentication methods to prevent weaker or unsupported MFA options

# Workflow Logic Summary
- User account is created or updated
- Okta evaluates the user’s department attribute
- Users with a department set to contractor are automatically added to the Contractor group
- Contractor-specific password and authentication policies are applied
- Access and authentication behavior are enforced consistently across contractor accounts
# Business Impact
- Automated contractor classification and policy enforcement
- Reduced manual effort in managing non-employee access
- Improved security posture for third-party and temporary users
- Ensured consistent application of stronger authentication controls
- Supported least-privilege and zero-trust identity principles
# Key Skills Demonstrated
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Identity lifecycle management
- Secure authentication policy design
- MFA enforcement and factor restrictions
- Okta group rule configuration

  


In the "BEFORE" metrics analysis, all resources were initially deployed and left exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls configured with open access, while all other resources were deployed with public endpoints accessible from the Internet, rendering private endpoints unnecessary.

In the "AFTER" metrics assessment, Network Security Groups underwent fortification by enforcing a stringent policy, blocking ALL traffic except for connections originating from my designated admin workstation. Furthermore, additional protection was afforded to all other resources through the reinforcement of their built-in firewalls, supplemented by the implementation of Private Endpoints.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2024-01-27T02:37:14.7683908Z
Stop Time 2023-03-11T21:03:08.1360519Z

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 18380
| Syslog                   | 13314
| SecurityAlert            | 6
| SecurityIncident         | 334
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 58501

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hours after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after I applied security controls:
Start Time 2024-02-07T02:31:10.4920242Z
Stop Time	2024-02-08T02:31:10.4920242Z

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 9590
| Syslog                   | 0
| SecurityAlert            | 1
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this Azure-based project, a mini honeynet was meticulously crafted, with log sources seamlessly integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Leveraging Microsoft Sentinel, the system adeptly triggered alerts and swiftly addressed incidents based on the processed logs.

A pivotal aspect of the project involved meticulously measuring metrics within the insecure environment before the implementation of security controls. After the fortification measures, a follow-up evaluation of metrics was conducted, showcasing a remarkable reduction in security events and incidents. This significant decrease underscores the efficacy of the implemented security measures.

Furthermore, it's pertinent to acknowledge that in environments where resources are extensively utilized by regular users, there could be a higher frequency of security events and alerts in the 24 hours following the implementation of security controls.
